    below you find a mail from monit-general, which describes in short, how
    to build a SuSE RPM from the sources plus the files you find in here.
    By times I will rewrite it. (Suggestions and corrections welcome.)

    So far, remember to check the version in monit.spec.
    Or check for ready packages on http://savannah.gnu.org/download/monit/

    The spec in suse/7.3 should work with 7.2 and 7.1, too.

    Have fun!
    Leppo.

Yep. And it's easy. Guess you have a RPM system, just do:

    cp monit.init /usr/src/packages/SOURCES/
    cp monit.rc.config /usr/src/packages/SOURCES/

    cp monit-2.4.3.tar.gz /usr/src/packages/SOURCES/

    cp monit.spec /usr/src/packages/SPECS/

(This is what the src.rpm install would do. - Well, the SRPM is about 270K
big, a bit too large as to be send to a mailing list...)

A   rpm -ba /usr/src/packages/SPECS/monit.spec  then builds

    /usr/src/packages/RPMS/i386/monit-2.4.3-8k.i386.rpm
    /usr/src/packages/SRPMS/monit-2.4.3-8k.src.rpm

To integrate it into the RPM system, execute (f.e.):

    rpm -Uvh /usr/src/packages/RPMS/i386/monit-2.4.3-8k.i386.rpm

The whole outcome with my spec is a SuSE 7.3 (7.2, 7.1) compliant RPM.
monit.init will be installed as /etc/init.d/monit (plus runlevel links)
monit.rc.config goes into /etc/rc.config.d/
Your monitrc wents in as /etc/monit.conf.
Edit monit.conf, set START_MONIT to 'yes' in /etc/rc.config.d/monit.rc.config
and that's it.
Documentation will be found under /usr/share/doc/packages/monit and in
/usr/share/man/man1.

Because of the differences in the init process and the system configuration,
RedHat RPMs mostly won't work on SuSE boxes and vice versa.

As we introduced monit to look for our apache-2.0.39 production server, I will
rebuild monit by times.
If you like, I can continue contributing the SuSE 7.x specs and files.
If you wish to offer RPMs, we have to solve the trust problem (md5sums,
pgpkeys).
For the moment I'd rather encourage to put the SuSE spec and files plus this
mail as 'README.SuSE' together into a special contrib subfolder.

The here apended SuSE spec contains a minor fix to the one posted yesterday,
as it lists the last entry in '%files' correcctly as '%doc' and not as
'%dir'.
(What lacks at the moment to get things fully compliant are merely some
clean-ups in the init script and corrected 'neededforbuild' and
'usedforbuild' entries in the spec. But that doesn't matter much to get
things running.)
By times I can mangle it to have a SuSE 8.0 compliant spec + rpm, too.

If you like to have me maintaining the SuSE stuff in cvs, okay.

Thomas Oppel
