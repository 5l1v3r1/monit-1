Monit is an open-source project consisting of non-paid volunteers who
contribute work and code to the project in their own free time. The
project consists of a core team of developers and many contributors
from around the world. This page lists all of the people who have gone
the extra mile and have contributed to the monit project. If
<u>you</u> want to contribute code or documentation to the project you
should join the <a
href="http://lists.nongnu.org/mailman/listinfo/monit-dev">developer
mailing list</a> and post your patch or code there.


<P>We ask that you please do not send us emails privately asking for
support. Instead, we have setup a <a
href="http://lists.nongnu.org/mailman/listinfo/monit-general">mailing
list</a> which contain many individuals who will help answer detailed
requests for help. The benefit of using a mailing lists over private
communication is that it is a shared resource where others can also
learn from common mistakes.

<h1>Thank You!</h1> Thanks to everyone who has contributed to the
monit project and to all those that are using the monit software! 
Thanks to everyone on the monit mailing lists for actively creating a
community around the project and for helping out with answers and
sharing tips and hacks.

<h3>Getting involved</h3>

The monit project operates on a meritocracy: the more you do, the more
responsibility you will obtain. If you would like to get involved, the
first step is to join the <A HREF=
"http://mail.freesoftware.fsf.org/mailman/listinfo/monit-general">mailing
lists</A>.

<p>The next step is to use the product, report bugs, making feature
requests, et cetera. <A
HREF="http://savannah.nongnu.org/cvs/?group=monit">Download the
developer source code via anonymous CVS</A>, get familiar with the
code base and contribute code or documentation patches. To join the
monit project team you must have contributed significant code to the
project and been an active member of the mailing lists for some
time. If you have done this and want to join the project, let us
know. As a project member you will get to vote and decide on future
directions of the project. You will also get write access to the CVS
repository.


<h3>Decision Making</h3>

All Contributors are encouraged to participate in decisions, but
the decision itself is made by those that have Committer status
in the Project. I.e. write access to the CVS repository. 

<p>Each vote can be made in one of three flavors:

<table id="content" cellspacing=5>
<tr>
<td valign=top><h3>+1</h3></td>
<td>
"Yes," "Agree," or "the action should be performed." On some
         issues this is only binding if the voter has tested the
         action on their own system(s). 
</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td valign=top><h3>0</h3></td>
<td>
"Abstain," "no opinion". An abstention may have detrimental
         effects if too many people abstain.
</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td valign=top><h3>-1</h3></td>
<td>
No." On issues where consensus is required, this vote counts
         as a veto. All vetos must contain an explanation of why the
         veto is appropriate. Vetos with no explanation are void. No
         veto can be overruled. If you disagree with the veto, you
         should lobby the person who cast the veto. Voters intending
         to veto an action item should make their opinions known to
         the group immediately so that the problem can be remedied as
         early as possible.
