Monit Security Advisory [05 April 2004]

Updated version of monit is now available which correct two security
issues:


1. Monit HTTP Interface Buffer Overflow Vulnerability
=====================================================

Monit implements a simple HTTP interface that supports Basic
authentication. This interface suffers from a buffer overflow
vulnerability when handling a client that authenticates with malformed
credentials. An attacker could send a carefully crafted Authorization
header to the monit server and cause the server to either crash or
worse to execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the monit user.


2. Off-By-One Overflow in Monit HTTP Interface
==============================================

This buffer overflow lies in the handling of POST submissions with
entity bodies. If the request body has the exact length of X bytes,
monit will write one byte past its designated input buffer. This error
can cause the monit server to crash.


Recommendations
---------------

Upgrade to monit version 4.2.1. (or turn off http support in previous
monit versions)
